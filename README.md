# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-using-NN
Digit Recognition using MNIST database. Repository includes some examples of self-made datasets, which are tested on the neural network. The accuracy of our self-made dataset is compared to the test dataset from the MNIST.

Image Size: 28x28 square grid
Color format: Grayscale

If you are looking forward to replicate the results, the "SavedWights" folder includes a set of saved weights increasing the number of ecpochs.
Only replace both files in the initial directory if want to use, previously calculated weights.


**Note: This is the final project of multiprocessors class.**

## Results

Results parameters:
- `Epochs: 5`
- `learning_rate = 0.1`

### Self-made datasets
The following datasets were made with GIMP and the numbers made with the brush tool by using an image size of 28x28. All images were exported in PNG format and stored for their use.
